## üßê About <a name = "about" id="about"></a>

This repository consists of the following projects which by order also corresponds to the workshop flow: 
- non-bundled-site. A simple site using a main Javascript file and an imported module file.
- bundled-site. A simple site using also a Javascript file and an imported module file but also [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) is used.
- angular-form. An Angular project with a [Reactive Form](https://angular.io/guide/reactive-forms) with input validation using ReactiveFormsModule module.
- react-form. A ReactJS project with a form with input validation.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started" id="getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need to install nodeJS >= v14.21.3 and npm >= v6.14.18. You should check it via:
```
node -v
npm -v
```
In order to install nodeJS please refer to [NodeJS page](https://nodejs.org/en).

- bundled-site
```
cd bundled-site
npm i && npm run build && npx serve
```
- angular-form and react-form
